      <p>We will be using a database backend for a website titled "Digital PCs" in
         order to catalog customer purchases and order history. The main purpose
         of this system/website is to enable customers to purchase PC parts and
         accessories to build their customized dream desktop. We required this to
         be hosted as a back-end database because we can store customer information
         and thus it allows us to have proper communication with our customers and
          it gives us data on our products, such as which of our products are being
           sold more or less. Digital PCs sell $1 million of PC parts annually.
           In our company, this translates to approximately 1200 parts being sold
           by the year.
